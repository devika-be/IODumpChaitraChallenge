# IODumpChaitraChallenge
The IODump Chaitra Challenge - a 30-day programming challenge that will put my skills to the test! ðŸ¤“
Starting from the Marathi New Year, Gudi Padwa, and running throughout the Chaitra month of the Hindu calendar, this challenge will give me a chance to stay consistent with programming while also learning about Git and GitHub - the ultimate platforms for open-source collaboration. ðŸŒŸ
